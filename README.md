# For the Project Reviewer

    This section will eventually contain any instructions and comments...
     the project reviewer will need to
        make it easier to review and grade the project.

## Project Progress

    Completed: Before You Start.

    In-Progess: Reviewing Sequelize workshops and database courses

## Issues and Challenges:

    Lots pages and subpages in the html-mockup
      meaning lots of components and sub-components

    Will need to make sure I don't make the routing over-complicated

    UI and UI-controls will need change based on context of data presented

    This is an Express.js app
      Sequelize for data
        Pug for html rendering
          with http server npm module

      Before You Start:

      I did indeed, download the project files

[For the original project files and a readme follow this link](https://github.com/pereznetworks/TD-Project10/tree/master/project-file-library-manager-v1)

      Read, studied and created...
        my own markdown-style version of the project instructions

      Created this markdown-style project readme to...
       track and document...
        my progress through this project.

      Will eventually be a how-to for developers and other students...
        who want to clone, download and work...
         on their version of this project.
